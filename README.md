# Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website. The site contains all of my work, achievements and experience in the tech field. It was a fully original experience with a focus on design, functionality, responsiveness and usability created with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. A lot of inspiration came from those I have seen making portfolio websites to showcase their games, apps, skills, tools, and more! Besides, it can help when trying to land a job position.

I built this site from the ground up using simple HTML to establish structure, paired with custom styled CSS rendering a contemporary aesthetic and infused Javascript for functional integration. My goal was to create a lightweight, mobile-responsiveness site that reflects me and my work in the industry for practical, realistic application purposes. My portfolio websites features a detailed bio, my interests and hobbies, my achievements and awards, some stats like my unweighted GPA, and current/past projects of mine!
